            <h3 id="preface"> <strong>Introduction</strong> </h3>
            <p>Let us go back to our childhood. 
                
                When we had a choice of studying Vs playing, what did we opt for?
               
                And when we did spend our time playing, did we just have pure fun, or did we also learn things?
                
                I am sure you all agree that play was much more than fun. It provided an opportunity to interact with others, learn in a safe and a comfortable environment.
                As adults, does this change? No, not much. How many of you look forward to team building sessions and outings Vs formal training sessions?
                And yet the common misconception is play and work are opposites. Let us try and debunk this myth. These stories could be a starting point.</p>
                <h3 id="believe"><strong>BELIEVE IT OR NOT</strong></h3>
                

<p>
1)	An IT Service provider Savvis introduced a learning game to improve negotiation skills and customer communication. Within 6 weeks of launching the 8-10-hour programme, a whopping 80% of learners had completed it. Getting teams to take up training from sales time is not usually easy but the gamification played a big role in making this happen.
<br>
2)   Triskelion is a time management game developed by Gamelearn to help individuals in fast paced jobs to manage their workload more effectively and become more productive. The game was so engaging that it saw a 92% completion rate and 97% of students applied the training in their jobs.
<br>
3)	DuoLingo is an app designed to help people learn another language in small bytes. Professors at City University of New York and the University of South Carolina found that after 34 hours using DuoLingo, learners could reach a level that would take over 130 hours in a traditional college scenario.
<br>
4)	The McDonald's Till game is a simulation designed to improve sales by making till service more efficient. Although the game wasn’t a mandatory part of their training, the game attracted 145,000 visits in its first year. The initiative also got positive reviews from the learners with 85% stating that the game helped them understand the system, thereby improving their performance. Since launch, this resulted in an additional profit of £23.7 million – and that’s just in the UK!

<br>
5)	Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) faced an interesting and formidable challenge: deliver Development/Test-as-a-service) as part of a billion-dollar contract to a major government organization on an accelerated time-to-market schedule. CSC wanted an innovative approach that would break down organization barriers, discard traditional approaches and leverage key strategic technology partners. Experts from four different companies were invited to Colorado for several days of a summit/retreat. Each company brought its own viewpoint and agenda; bringing them together would be a daunting challenge. The facilitator decided to leverage Innovation Games, a suite of strategic games designed to break down barriers and foster alignment and commitment across and between organizations. During the two and a half days of the summit, partners played interactive win-win games aimed at identifying issues, roadblocks, and challenges, and then exploring and prioritizing potential solutions, with the goal of developing a clear road map. The participants quickly developed into tightly aligned teams that worked together to good effect: the project was delivered successfully 20 months ahead of schedule.
<br>
6)	Rotterdam Eye Hospital staff have improved patient care and raised staff morale at a very modest cost: 10 minutes a day and a special deck of cards. Hospital managers developed a special patient-safety card game that encouraged co-workers to work together more easily and reinforced their knowledge of core safety and patient care principles. This routinely played game has improved the hospital’s performance on its patient-safety, and caregiver job satisfaction has improved substantially, moving from 8.0 to 9.2 on a 10-point scale. The nursing home and rehabilitation centre reported similar results. The staffers have observed a variety of other gains as well. For instance, the game has encouraged team members to get to know each other better, and patients are reassured when team members are familiar with each other.
